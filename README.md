# Rules To Follow while sending pull request:
- Please follow the file structure given, i.e Put your code in the respective folders only. Example if you want to add a data structure in cpp language do it in the specific folder. If you prefer in another language make a new folder (if not already present) and follow the same file structure there. 
- Do not push spam codes (They should be proper codes and not just one liners or space fixes).

# See you on 9th!
